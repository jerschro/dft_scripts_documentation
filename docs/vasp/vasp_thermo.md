I made scripts similar to the [turbomole/freeh](../turbomole/freeh.md) scripts but for VASP frequency calculations.

## Scripts that are needed to produce a thermo .csv file from vasp.

1. /home/jerschro/Scripts/vasp/vasp_thermo/auto_thermo.sh
1. /home/jerschro/Scripts/vasp/vasp_thermo/vasp_thermo_results.sh
1. /home/jerschro/Scripts/vasp/vasp_thermo/thermo_to_csv.py

Read top information in each file and change the variables in the top for what you need.

Contact Jeremy for more information. These scripts need some work and are not that intuitive at the moment.
